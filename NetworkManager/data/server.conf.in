# This is a sample configuration file that could be edited and
# dropped into @sysconfdir@/NetworkManager/conf.d to disable certain
# bits of automatic behavior that might not be wanted on servers.

[main]

# Normally, NetworkManager reloads connection files on disk any time
# they are changed. Setting "monitor-connection-files=false" will
# disable this behavior, and NetworkManager will then only read
# connection files at startup, and when explicitly requested via
# D-Bus.

#monitor-connection-files=false


# Normally, if there is an ethernet device that is not matched by any
# existing configured connection, NetworkManager will create a
# "default" connection for that device, using automatic (DHCP/SLAAC)
# IP configuration. You can use no-auto-default to disable this
# behavior for individual devices or for all devices on the system
#
# Note that if you delete an existing "default" connection, NM will
# remember this by adding the device's hardware address to
# @localstatedir@/run/NetworkManager/no-auto-default.state; the devices
# indicated in this file will be appended to the value of the
# no-auto-default key.

#no-auto-default=eth0,eth1
#no-auto-default=11:22:33:44:55:66
#no-auto-default=*


# Normally, for device types that support carrier-detect, such as
# Ethernet and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only allow a connection
# to be activated on the device if carrier is present (ie, a cable is
# plugged in). You can set ignore-carrier to disable this behavior,
# for individual devices or for all devices on the system.
#
# Note that the "carrier" property of NMDevices and device D-Bus
# interfaces will still reflect the actual device state; it's just
# that NetworkManager will not make use of that information.
#
# You should probably not set this to apply to devices where you are
# doing automatic IP config, since they will eventually fail if there
# is no actual network connectivity, and NetworkManager won't retry
# them right away when carrier comes back up (since it's ignoring it).

#ignore-carrier=eth0,ib0
#ignore-carrier=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
#ignore-carrier=*


# Normally, NetworkManager adjusts /etc/resolv.conf to point to the
# name servers associated with currently-active connections (either
# manually-configured servers, or ones received via DHCP, etc).
# Setting "dns=none" will turn off this behavior, and NetworkManager
# will leave /etc/resolv.conf untouched. See NetworkManager.conf.5 for
# more information about other values you can set this to.

#dns=none
